Abstract
--------
#### The longevity of a civilization is predicted on many things, among them: its access to safe drinking water. The ability to determine the chemical or biological composition of a water supply exists beyond the reach of the majority of people, whether it be inability or inaction people fall victim to contaminated water. Both in the developing world, and in developed world cases of toxic water arise, as commonly seen in Africa, or the city of Flint, Michigan. Whilst, chemical tests already exist this project serves to investigate a possible alternative, that alternative is the use of Light to identify impurities in water. Hypothetically, there is no better comparison than an elementary particle, least of all the quantum of the electromagnetic spectrum. Photometric comparison will suffer no smaller unit of matter, resulting in lossless recognition of both chemical and biological contaminates.

#### All of this can be accomplished provided the testing device is designed properly, therein lies the goal and direction of this project. We must understand the traits of common contaminates, as well as distinct ways in which light interacts with substances. In order to accomplish this feat, we must utilize a variety of scientific orientations (i.e. Physics, Biology, and Chemistry) to create a device that cohesively functions to produce results that help mitigate water related health risks. The greatest issue that the project must address is the ability to make a distinction between chemical, and biological contaminates.

## Aquaspector Device General Overview
#### The Aquaspector has two designed versions, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. The *Field Device* is designed for environments whose testing conditions are initially unknown, and subject to change; this version allows the user to define these variables depending on such variation, and is therefore meant for versatile scientific usage. The *Faucet Device* is exactly as it sounds, an integrated design allows the device to have a significantly reduced form factor and is intended to be used as an attachment to consumer faucets; as a result of the reduced form factor this version utilizes low-power forms of spectral analysis fit for environments whose testing conditions are not subject to variation (i.e. a kitchen faucet).
